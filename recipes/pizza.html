      <li>1 tablespoon sugar.</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1⅓ cups warm water (120 to 130 degrees f/50 degress C).</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1:</strong> Start a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill
          to medium-high heat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 2:</strong> COmbine 2 cups flour, undissolved yeast,
          sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and 1/3 cup oil; mix
          until well blended, about 1 minute. <br />
          Gradually add enough flour to make a soft dough that forms a ball and
          is slightly sticky. Knead on a floured surface, adding additional
          flour if necessary, <br />
          until smooth and elastic but not sticky, about 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 3:</strong> Divide dough into 8 portions. Pat or roll
          dough on a well-floured counter to about 8-inch cirls; they do not
          need to be perfect.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 4:</strong> Brush both sides of crusts with additional
          oil. Using hands, lift each crust carefully and place on grill. Cook
          for 3 to 4 minutes ultin bottoms are lightly <br />
          browned and tops look set. Using long handled tongs, remove crusts
          from grill and place on a baking sheet with grilled-sides facing up.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 5:</strong> Lightly add sauce to the top of each grilled
          crust, then top with mozzarella cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 6:</strong> Carefully slide pizzas back onto the grill.
          Cook and additional 3 to 4 minutes until bottom crusts are browned and
          cheese is melted. <br />
          Remove from the grill and serve immediately.
